## Manage your Vagrant boxes and/or VMs

### With vagrant cli [docs](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli)
```bash
vagrant global-status                           # Gets a list of your current Vagrant boxes
vagrant reload [vagrant box name (type)|id]     # Reloads a change of config on your Vagrantfile

vagrant ssh [vagrant box name (type)|id] [-- extra_ssh_args]

vagrant suspend [vagrant box name (type)|id]    # Suspends the guest machine, rather than fully shutting it down or destroying it
vagrant resume [vagrant box name (type)|id]     # Resumes a Vagrant managed machine that was previously suspended
vagrant halt [vagrant box name (type)|id]       # Shuts down the running machine Vagrant is managing

vagrant snapshot save [vm-name] NAME            # Saves a new named snapshot
vagrant snapshot restore [vm-name] NAME         # Restores the named snapshot

vagrant destroy [vagrant box name (type)|id]    # Destroy your VM using an id obtained from `vagrant global-status`
vagrant box remove NAME                         # Delete the box being used to create the VM
```

### With Vagrant Manager
Run `Vagrant Manager.app`

### With VirtualBox
Run `VirtualBox.app` (does not update your user Vagrant configuration though)

### Troubleshooting & Improvements
- If you try to start your VM and it does not boot up at all, check to make sure you have enough RAM to run your VM.
Change the `vb.memory` value of the related VM in your `Vagrantfile` and run a `vagrant reload [vagrant box name (type)|id]`.
- VirtualBox uses the left command key as the "host key" by default. If you want to use it for shortcuts like `command+c` or `command-v` (copy&paste), you need to remap or unset the "Host Key Combination" in `Preferences -> Input -> Virtual Machine`.
- Keep in mind that the Video Memory Apple's official requirement is 128MB.
- If keyboard and mouse do not work inside the VM:
    1. Ensure the [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) is installed.
    2. In the VM settings, under `Ports > USB`, select `USB 3.0 (xHCI) Control`.
